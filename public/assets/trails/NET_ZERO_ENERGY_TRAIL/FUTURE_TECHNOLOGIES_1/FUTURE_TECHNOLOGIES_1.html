  <p>Have you wondered what happens to the comfort feedback you give in the learning trail app? </p>

<p>That data gets collected and processed to determine your personal comfort profile. In essence, the application will know what your sound, thermal and lighting preferences are. From this information, it will tell you which parts of the SDE4 building suit your personal preference. This functionality is being integrated into a hot-desking application at the NUS, which will recommend, and book work-spaces for you based on your comfort preference. </p>
