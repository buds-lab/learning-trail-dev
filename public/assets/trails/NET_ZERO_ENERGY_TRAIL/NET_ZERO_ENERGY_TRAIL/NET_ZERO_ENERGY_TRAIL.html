  <h2>Net Zero Energy</h2>
  <p>
    SDE4 is a Net Zero Energy Building (NZEB), which means it consumes as much energy as it produces within its site boundary. Consumption and production figures are balanced over the course of one year, allowing for periods when consumption is higher than production and vice versa.
