    Automation and configurability in the transfer of information between open 3D data standards – IFC & CityGML – allowing for the geometric and semantic enhancement of use-case-specific aspects of buildings within 3D city models, so that information contained within native Building Information Modelling (BIM) can be made accessible and available in more diverse geospatial contexts and scenarios. This R&D is one of a number of funded projects directly supporting Virtual Singapore to enable digital transformation in the development new types of Smart Cities services and applications.
