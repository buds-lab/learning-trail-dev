  <h2>BIM - SPATIO TEMPORAL PLATFORM</h2>
  <p>
    IoT sensors collect massive amounts of temporal data, playing a major role in different aspects facilities management and building performance optimization. These data are often displayed without any connection to the building's spatial layout, making them difficult to interpret and analyze. We developed an approach to visualize temporal data in the spatial domain by making use of building information models (BIM). The aim is to integrate visual analytics, temporal sensor data, and spatial BIM information within a single platform for improved building management. The gaming engine  ''unity3d'' was used to enable interactive visualization within a hierarchical multi-layered spatiotemporal interface.
