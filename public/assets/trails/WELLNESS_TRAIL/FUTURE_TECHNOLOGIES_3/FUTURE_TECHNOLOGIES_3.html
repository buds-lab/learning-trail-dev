  <h2>INDOOR LOCALISATION</h2>
  <p>
     The SDE4 has been fitted with 120 bluetooth beacons for indoor localisation. You can see one on the column outside the window, to your right. These beacons work with the your cellphone to determine your indoor location, which can help you navigate the SDE4 building. The beacons can also be used for occupancy prediction, and be linked with the building management system for optimal occupant centered control.
