  <h2>AIR</h2>
  <p>
    Air quality is a key factor affecting health, comfort, and productivity of occupants in a building. SDE4 optimizes cross ventilation through its envelope design, giving occupants access to fresh air and control over their immediate surroundings. In case outside air quality is unfavorable, the building switches to air conditioning to limiting airflow from outside.
