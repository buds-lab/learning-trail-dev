  <h2>SKY TIMBER</h2>
  <p>
    In 2013, Singapore enabled one of the first Mass-Engineered Timber (MET) constructions in Asia. However, most projects are to import the MET from Europe due to its Eurocode compliance. Due to year-round sunlight, tropical plantation species may grow up to four times faster than those in a temperate climate, which may eventually have relatively weak mechanical properties on their own but which may become suitable for construction use if developed into MET. 

    For the sustainable future, Sky Timber project challenges a series of issues: I. Sustainable Tropical Forestry, II. Tropical MET Prototyping, III. Weathering and Humidity Resistance Testing and IV. Architectonics Studies.
