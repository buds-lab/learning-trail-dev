  <h2>Tropical Architecture</h2>
  <p>
    Tropical Architecture is a strategic arrangement of elements in buildings to respond to specific conditions of weather, sun, and climate prevalent in the tropical region. Designing for tropical climate requires attention to the use of passive design elements to nurture the design potential and moderate the climate conditions. SDE4 uses a combination of climatic strategies to emerge as a model of sustainable design for Singapore and the tropics.
