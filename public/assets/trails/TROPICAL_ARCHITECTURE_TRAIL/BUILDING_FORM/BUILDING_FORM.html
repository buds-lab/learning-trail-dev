    SDE4 is designed in response to Singapore's tropical climate - with orientation of the building along the east-west direction to minimize direct solar heat gain and maximise cross flow of prevailing winds. It takes into consideration seasonality, sun movement, natural shade and other environmental factors such as wind, rainfall, and humidity, to provide comfortable and energy efficient spaces.
