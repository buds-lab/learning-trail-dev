  <h2>NUS-CDL Tropical Technologies LAB</h2>
  <p>
    The NUS-CDL Tropical Technologies Laboratory (T2 Lab) was founded in April 2016 with the sponsorship of City Development Limited (CDL). The Lab encompasses various research interests relevant to the architecture and building in the tropics. Especial emphasis are given to the integration of solar (BIPV) and farming systems and tropical timber technologies into buildingsâ€™ envelope. Their thermal, ventilation and visual performance and their productivity and aesthetics are assessed. The lab will propitiate the conception, exploration, development and implementation of the future facade and building technologies for Singapore and tropical regions considering the challenges of climate change and the potential use of technological innovation.
