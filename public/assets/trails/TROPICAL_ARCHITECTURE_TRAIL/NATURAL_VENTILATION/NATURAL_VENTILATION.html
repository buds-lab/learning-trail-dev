  <h2>Natural Ventilation</h2>
  <p>
    SDE4's design is comprised of large open spaces, with the internal volumes being smaller forms for minimal obstruction to windflow.
	The building orientation faces the natural direction of wind flow across the site, enabling cross ventilation across the entire block.
