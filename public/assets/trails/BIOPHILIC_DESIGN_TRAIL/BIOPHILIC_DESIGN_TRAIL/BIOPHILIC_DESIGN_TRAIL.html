  <h2>Biophilic Design</h2>
  <p>
    Biophilic design is fundamental to SDE4 - exhibited by its open design, and visual and physical connection with surrounding natural elements. SDE4 uses biophilic design principles to establish, nurture and enhance its relationship with its sorroundings. Incorporation of these biophilic principles help reduce stress, enhance clarity of thought, and improve well-being in the buildingâ€™s occupants.
