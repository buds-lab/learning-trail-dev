  <h2>NATURE OF PLACE</h2>
  <p>
    ‘Nature of Place’ draws upon the human attribute to see beyond their immediate surroundings and a fascination with the unknown.
	SDE4 incorporates this virtue by its open design, providing visual connections coupled with physical sheltering. This evokes a sense of intrigue and wonder, all being experienced within the safety of the habitat for its occupants.
