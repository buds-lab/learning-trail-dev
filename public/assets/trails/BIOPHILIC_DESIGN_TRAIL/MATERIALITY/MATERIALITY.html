  <h2>MATERIALITY</h2>
  <p>
    The experience of natural analogs by virtue of manifestation in organic, non-living and indirect evocations of nature is the underlying concept of materiality. This includes objects, materials, colors, shapes, sequences, and patterns found in nature, replicated or mimicked within the built environment in various forms. 
	SDE4â€™s use of raw concrete, timber fixtures and fitting and floor patterns create an esoteric yet comprehensible analog to nature and biophilia.
