  <h2>Nature In Place</h2>
  <p>
    ‘Nature in Place’ addresses the direct, physical and ephemeral presence of nature in space. SDE4 incorporates this through landscaping elements at level 6, open views to the surrounding landscape and water features that are activated when raining. The building’s operable envelope design also allows for air flow to vary with the outdoor conditions, and for natural light to enter deep into spaces.
