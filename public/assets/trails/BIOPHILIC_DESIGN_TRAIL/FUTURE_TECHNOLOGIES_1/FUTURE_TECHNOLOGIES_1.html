  <h2>BIOPHILIC PROFILING OF SPACES</h2>
  <p>
    Integrating biophilic elements in buildings have positive physiological and physical well-being effects to user in the building. However, there determine the biophilic profile of a building/space have been a challenge, unless design and building process have been carried out.  The development of the biophilic analytical tool allow user to assess the biophilic profile in a semi-quantitative manner, providing designers/building owner a mean to determine the biophilic profile of space before construction, saving cost and time.
