  <h2>Hybrid Cooling</h2>
  <p>
    Integral to the concept of net-zero energy for SDE4 was the need to rethink strategies of design and implementation for air-conditioning, which accounts for over 60 percent of the buildingâ€™s total energy load. The resulting solution was the innovative, mixed-mode hybrid cooling system, that ensures maintains indoor air quality and optimum cooling of spaces while minimising energy consumption.
