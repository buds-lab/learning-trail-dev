  <h2>Adaptive Cooling</h2>
  <p>
    SDE4 gives users greater control over their immediate environment through munual controls like openable windows and adjustable fans speeds. This allows the occupants to adapt to (or even prefer) a wider range of thermal conditions that are often beyond conventional boundaries of thermal comfort in the tropics.
