  <h2>Enhanced Indoor Environmental Quality</h2>
  <p>
    SDE4 uses a single-pass pre-cooled fresh air system and operable windows to condition spaces. The hybrid cooling zones achieve a much higher indoor air quality in comparison to traditional air conditioning systems augmented with natural daylighting due to an optimised envelope design. Additionally, allowing users to control ceiling fans for elevated thermal comfort further enhances the indoor environmental quality of the building.
