    SDE4 utilizes a novel approach to offer thermally comfortable spaces to occupants while saving more energy, this system is called the Hybrid cooling (HC). It is a result of intensive simulation and experimental research
by building scientists at NUS which benefits from the fact that human body can still feel comfortable if the temperature is higher e.g. 28 degrees, if air movement is elevated. This is achieved by coupling ceiling fans with the air conditioning system. The
current demo illustrates an experiment of the hybrid cooling system thermal comfort with different fan speeds.
