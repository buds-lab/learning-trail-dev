    SDE4's hybrid cooling system is a single-pass system with no recirculated air that supplies rooms with pre-cooled air, albeit at higher temperatures and humidity levels than a conventional system, with the addition of elevated air speed by ceiling fans. This cool circulating air generates a comfort condition that is significantly better than conventional overcooled spaces. This system is augmented with natural ventilation by means of operable windows to allow fresh air into the space.
