  <h2>BIO RETENTION BASIN</h2>
  <p>
    At SDE4, one-third of the rainwater runoff from the roof is conveyed into the bioretention basin located in the landscaped area. The basin slows down the run-off, embellishes the landscape and filters water through a dense vegetation layer. The harvested water is then used for irrigation and other non-potable water demands of the building.
