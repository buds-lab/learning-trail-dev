  <h2>Water Feature</h2>
  <p>
     SDE4â€™s landscape seamlessly integrates greenery, water, and community through spaces that support everyday activities. For instance, this water feature is only active when it rains - adding sound, texture, and movement to the landscape while also becoming a pedagogical tool for teaching and research.
