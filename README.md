# The Learning Trail Project
We propose an integrated framework for the digital showcase of SDE IV Launch Event where “Learning Trail” is the central experience. The learning trail would include primary, secondary info points and a large  “dynamic stories” screen, which let building users learn more about the building and its sustainability features through the SDE IV App.
Elements of the Learning Trail

## Info Points:
There will be two kinds of info points -  primary and secondary -  which will be placed at different points/ spaces in the building. The design guidelines for primary info points have already been developed with Giovanni’s efforts, we will only be adding a QR code to the design for SDE IV mobile app integration. 





Relationship between primary and secondary info points


### Primary Points: 
These info points would be based on 6 categories shown below. These will be placed as shown at different parts of the building.

### Secondary Points:
These will be offshoots from primary info points but would provide more granular information or highlight connected information regarding building components and sustainability features of SDE IV. Each primary info point could potentially have 2 - 4 secondary info points to showcase specific aspects for the building. The secondary info points could be stickers with QR codes placed in the vicinity of its primary info point.

## Scavenger Hunt: 
After a user scans a primary info point, they will be prompted by the app to look for the secondary info points associated with it. On completion for a branch of primary and secondary info points, users would be prompted to look for other branches. In total, there will be 7 primary info point branches with a total of maximum 25 secondary info points, i.e 2 - 4 secondary info points for each primary info point. If possible, we can attribute rewards, SDE IV memorabilia or special titles for users who are able to find & scan all primary and secondary building on the day of the launch.

## Dynamic Stories Screen: 
This would be the large screen placed at an important space in the building. This screen would provide an overview of the 7 categories of primary info points and their location in the building. 

The 7 primary info point categories would also act as the basis for information, graphics, and visualisations each “story”. So with 7 primary info points, we propose 7 stories. Each story would be a collection of graphics, text and data visualizations for its category. By default, these stories will be playing in loop one after the other, but they can also be controlled by individuals through selected hand gestures. We propose each story to be of 1-minute duration, with all seven stories to complete playing in a total 7 minutes back to back by default. 





## Demos/Installations:
This will be a showcase of nano climate structures and digital installations for the launch. The scope of this is still to be decided.
